## 1 - 2 (- 3)

In the following, VESRION is the kind of docker image you want to use

    - 'latest' - minimal install of latest NEST release
    - 'nightly' - minimal install of latest MEST master branch
    - '2.12.0' - complete install of NEST 2.12.0
    - '2.14.0' - complete install of NEST 2.14.0
    - 'all' - with 'all' you get all

Two little steps to get started

### 1 - Provisioning

    sh nest-docker.sh provision VERSION

### 2 - Run

-   with Jupyter Notebook

        sh nest-docker.sh run notebook VERSION

    Open the displayed URL in your browser and have fun with Jupyter
    Notebook and NEST.

-   in interactive mode

        sh nest-docker.sh run interactive VERSION

    After the prompt 'Your python script:' enter the filename of the script
    you want to start. Only the filename without any path. The file has to
    be in the path where you start the script.

-   as virtual image

        sh nest-docker.sh run virtual VERSION

    You are logged in as user 'nest'. Enter 'python' and in the
    python-shell 'import nest'. A 'nest.help()' should display the main
    help page.

### (3) - Delete the NEST Images

    sh nest-docker.sh clean

Be careful. This stops EVERY container and delete then EVERY NEST Images.

## Useful Docker commands

-   Delete ALL images (USE WITH CAUTION!)

        docker system prune -fa --volumes

-   Export a docker image

        docker save nest/docker-nest-2.12.0 | gzip -c > nest-docker.tar.gz

-   Import a docker image

        gunzip -c nest-docker.tar.gz | docker load
